Thanks for stopping by. My name is Julius and I use data and economic theory to explore human behavior. In my current PhD at Hertie School, I study why people are honest, why real estate agents are so expensive and if alcohol causes violent crime. Evidently, instead of disciplines, I follow ideas. If you have any of those or want to discuss them, reach out to me.
