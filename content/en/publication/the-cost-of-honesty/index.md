  This paper studies honesty in the face of changing cost. 

  Using field data from a snack delivery company that employs an honesty payment system, the paper presents an event-study to analyze how price increases affect pay rates.

  produced electricity to shore is necessary. The development and operation of the

  offshore transmission asset is costly and regulated differently across the globe.

  In this paper, we collect a unique data set that allows to compare cost and quality of offshore transmission assets in

  two countries with different regulations. With project level

  data we can control for geographical and technical difference to assess which

  regulatory design might lead to lower economic costs for the offshore transmission

  asset. We find that a competitive regime that promotes the integration of wind farm and transmission leads to lower transmission cost and similar

  transmission availability.
