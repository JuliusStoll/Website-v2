  Offshore wind plays an ever-increasing role for the global transition to
  renewable

  energy. For offshore wind energy to be successful, cost-effective transport of the

  produced electricity to shore is necessary. The development and operation of the

  offshore transmission asset is costly and regulated differently across the globe.

  In most countries, the TSO is responsible for the transmission and develops and

  operates the asset separately from the offshore wind farm. Other countries have

  established a competitive tender with integrated development of the offshore wind

  farm and the transmission asset. However, there is so far no empirical analysis of

  the economic benefits of different regulatory designs regarding the offshore transmission

  assets. In this paper, we collect a unique data set on offshore transmission

  assets that compares empirical cost and quality of offshore transmission assets in

  two countries with different regulatory regimes for the first time. With project level

  data we can control for geographical as well as technical difference to assess which

  regulatory design might lead to lower economic costs for the offshore transmission

  asset. Comparing the cost in the two leading countries for offshore wind energy,

  we find that a competitive regime leads to lower transmission cost and similar

  transmission availability.
