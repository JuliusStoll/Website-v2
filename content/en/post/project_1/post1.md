I exploit a recent legal reform in Germany to expose excessive commission rates among real estate agents. Although the reform did not affect agents' marginal cost, I find that many agents exploited the blur of the transition to increase their total commission by 20-50 percent. Ruling out collusion, this arbitrary increase affirms a lack of price competition. I argue that this market failure arises from sellers not demanding lower commissions. To understand if and why sellers fail to negotiate when commissioning a real estate agent, I run a pre-registered survey experiment with 1,062 real estate agents. The survey confirms that 85 percent of sellers do not demand lower commission rates. I find that this is likely due to sellers perceiving the typically offered commission rate as a standard reference and erroneously expecting the agent to sell at a higher price that makes up the additional commission cost. Incentivising real estate agents in a randomized survey experiment suggests that they strategically communicate inflated commission norms and exaggerate their ability to sell at a higher price, despite knowing better.
